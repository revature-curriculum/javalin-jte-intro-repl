## JTE Intro
---
### Description
In this lab, we will cover how to display something dynamically using jte.

---
### Steps
1. In src -> main -> java -> Main.java, create a new path for '/nanoTime'
2. In this new path use ctx.render to show nanoTime.jte. Use the lesson example as reference.
3. In src -> main -> jte -> nanoTime.jte, use the System.nanoTime() method to print out the current nano time of the system. Use the time.jte file as reference.

### Sample Output
```
The current nano time is 37380372070875
```
